            Founded in 2010, our company started with a mission to provide
            reliable and affordable car rental services for everyone. From our
            humble beginnings with just a small fleet of cars, we have grown
            into a nationwide brand known for exceptional service and a wide
            selection of vehicles.
          </p>
          <p className='text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700'>
            Our vision is to make travel convenient, comfortable, and accessible
            to all by offering a seamless car rental experience, whether it's
            for a quick weekend getaway or an extended business trip.
          </p>
          <p className='text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700'>
            Over the years, we have continuously evolved, embracing the latest
            technology to enhance our offerings. Our dedication to customer
            satisfaction remains at the heart of everything we do.
